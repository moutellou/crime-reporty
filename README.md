Crime Mapping Application

We developed a simple crime mapping application that could be used to support community policing. It presents crime intensity within the City of Calgary. Incidences have been categorised by the Calgary Police, and the data were downloaded from the Calgary Police Website between November 2012 and February 2013. For the population data, we used 2011 Statistics Canada census data.
